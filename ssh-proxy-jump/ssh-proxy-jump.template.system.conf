# Client host settings for ssh-proxy-jump@.service template instances
# Save as /etc/ssh-proxy-jump/ssh-proxy-jump.conf
# See https://github.com/MestreLion/ssh-reverse-tunnel

# This will read /etc/ssh-proxy-jump for SSH keys and known_hosts,
# so only need to specify hosts connection info and non-default settings.

# Target host with custom ssh-proxy-jump service account installed
#Host example
#	Hostname               example.com
#	DynamicForward         1080

# Target host without ssh-proxy-jump service account: Must specify credentials
#Host example.no-service-account
#	Hostname               example.com
#	User                   someone
#	IdentityFile           /path/to/id_ed25519
#	DynamicForward         1080

# Target host that creates a reverse tunnel to this source host
#Host example.reverse-proxy
#	Hostname               localhost
#	Port                   22222
#	User                   someone
#	DynamicForward         20000

# ConnectTimeout=50
# Used only when connecting. Default is the system TCP timeout.
#
# DynamicForward=1080
# The default (client) proxy port to listen
#
# ExitOnForwardFailure=yes
# Disconnect and exit if ssh cannot set up port forwarding.
# Default: 'no', keeps the (useless) connection active.
#
# IdentityFile=~/.config/ssh-proxy-jump/id_ed25519
# Path to the private key. Default: ~/.ssh/id_{ed25519,rsa,...}
#
# LogLevel=DEBUG
# QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO (default), VERBOSE, DEBUG/DEBUG1, DEBUG2, DEBUG3
#
# RequestTTY=no
# Disable TTY allocation. Options: yes, no (-T), force (-t), auto (default?)
#
# ServerAliveInterval=20
# Time without data to check if server is alive. Default: 0, no check.
#
# ServerAliveCountMax=3
# Attempts for above check to fail before disconnecting. Default: already 3.
# Both combined means disconnect if server is unresponsive for 3*20=60 seconds.
# This is intentionally greater than the suggested 45 seconds for ClientAlive*
#
# StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
# Accept keys from new hosts and reject changed host keys.
# Default: 'ask', confirmation required for new hosts and reject changed keys.
#
# TCPKeepAlive=yes
# Periodically send TCP KeepAlive messages. Default: already 'yes'.
# Not related to the above options other than preventing server-side disconnects.
#
# UpdateHostKeys=yes
# Allows server to transparently present additional keys before revoking old ones
# Default: no
#
# User=ssh-proxy-jump
# Remote host user to log in as. Default is same local username connecting.
#
# UserKnownHostsFile=~/.config/ssh-proxy-jump/known_hosts
# Independent file for tunnel host keys, to avoid using /root/.ssh/known_hosts
# Default: ~/.ssh/known_hosts
