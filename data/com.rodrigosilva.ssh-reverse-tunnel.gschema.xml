		<description>
		If enabled, indicator will try to connect ssh-reverse-tunnel whenever it disconnects.
		If disabled, indicator will only reflect ssh-reverse-tunnel current status.
		This is similar to 'connect-on-start', but instead of only trying to connect once at
		indicator start, this keep reconnecting whenever it disconnects.
		Notice that if enabled this will nullify manual disconnects performed by the user,
		as the indicator will re-connect on the next update.

		<summary>How often, in seconds, to check connection status.</summary>
		<description>
		On every check, indicator runs `ssh-reverse-tunnel --status` and update its
		labels, menus and icons accordingly. This interval is possibly only set at indicator
		start, so restarting the indicator might be necessary for changes to apply.
		This also affects how often 'auto-reconnect' tries to re-connect, if that
		is enabled.
